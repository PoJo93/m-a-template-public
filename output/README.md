# Output Directory

This directory is where the generated Company Information Memorandums (CIM) will be created.

## Generated Files

When you run the CIM generation process, the following files will be created here:

- `draft_cim_DE.md` - German version of the CIM
- `questions.md` - List of questions that need clarification
- Additional versions may be created with version suffixes

## Usage

1. Place your company documents in `input/reference_documents/`
2. Run the CIM generation process
3. Review the generated files in this directory
4. Answer any questions listed in `questions.md`
5. Iterate as needed

## Note

All generated files are excluded from version control to protect proprietary information.
